In this project, we control a traffic light system. For that matter,
we define several simple rules.<br/>
Consider there are two traffic lights you want to control:<br/>
<br/>Light A: Controls the traffic flow between North and South.<br/>
Light B: Controls the traffic flow between West and East.<br/>
<br/>Rules:
1) Each light has the ability to show three different colors (Red, Yellow, Green).<br/>
2) Both lights cannot be green simultaneously.<br/>
3) Both lights cannot be yellow simultaneously.<br/>
4) The green color has to last for 6 seconds to let cars pass.<br/>
5) The yellow color has to last for 1 second to alert drivers not to pass.<br/>
