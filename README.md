In this project, we control a traffic light system. For that matter,
we define several simple rules.
Consider there are two traffic lights you want to control:
1. Ligh A: Controls the traffic flow between North and South.
2. Ligh B: Controls the traffic flow between West and East.
Rules:
1. Each light has the ability to show three different colors (Red, Yellow, Green).
2. Both lights cannot be green simultaneously.
3. Both lights cannot be yellow simultaneously.
4. The green color has to last for 6 seconds to let cars pass.
5. The yellow color has to last for 1 second to alert drivers not to pass
